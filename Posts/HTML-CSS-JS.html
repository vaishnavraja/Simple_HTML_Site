                <li>CSS or <b style="color: red;">Cascading style sheet</b> is a styling machanism for the web.</li>
                <li>It is a standard that describes <span style="color:chocolate";> selectors</span>, <span style="color: blue">properties</span> and <span style="color: green;">attributes</span> interpreted by web browsers.
                </li>
                <li>This standard continue to be developed as new features get added to the standard all the time.
                </li>
                <li>The CSS standard itself doesn't do anything. It just tells the people who created the web-browsers like Chrome, Firexbox and Edge, how to interpret the CSS language and how to style HTML with it.</li>
                <li>CSS is useful to separate style from content, where style is described in a .css documents and content in .html documents.</li>
                <li>CSS is a very rich standard that describes lots of capabilities. CSS-3 brought many advanced capabilities- like media queries, animations and gradients.</li>
                <li>There are different ways to use CSS-
                    <ul>
                        <li>by writing it from scratch using text editors or IDEs or</li>
                        <li>by using a CSS liabrary (Bootstrap) which provides pre-made styles. or</li>
                        <li>by writing it using CSS pre-processors (LESS) which provides a richer language to write CSS in and compile into regular CSS files, when you are done.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
            </ol>
